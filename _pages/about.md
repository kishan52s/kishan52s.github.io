I am a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, Ministry of Finance, Government of India. My Research Interests lie at the intersection of Development, (in) formal economy and Political Economics. I am looking for PhD (Doctoral) opportunities in (Applied) Economics or related area.

My current research studies the warranted and un-warranted subsidies in India. We are working on a Ministry of Finance and NITI Aayog's Project titled 'Rationalization of Explicit subsidies at State Level'. The study will bust the myth of so-called freebies and welfare measures taken by India's state and central government(s).

I am also a student activist at the Democratic Students' Federation(DSF-JNU), Jawaharlal Nehru University. It is an independent progressive student organization actively working on the JNU campus. I serve on the organization committee to evaluate and propose public education and marginalized welfare ideas. In Addition, I am working with different organizations toward marginalized welfare. My objective is to put forward marginalized perspectives that have largely been absent until now from the field of economics and Development.
